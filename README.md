# ‚ôüÔ∏è Chess Puzzle Game

A fun and educational chess puzzle game where you can challenge yourself or others with various puzzles. Includes customizable themes, adjustable AI difficulty levels, and multiple gameplay modes.

# Why I created this

Most popular chess apps lock their puzzle features behind paywalls, making it harder for people to access quality chess training tools. I built this game to offer free and open access to engaging chess puzzles for anyone who wants to improve their skills‚Äîno subscriptions, no ads.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Eklund2012/py-chess-puzzles.git
    cd py-chess-puzzles
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source venv/Scripts/activate  # On Linux or MacOS use `source venv/bin/activate`
    ```

4. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Run the game:
    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```
